      <p style="font-size: larger;">
        A treasure goes missing. A feudal lord dies, leaving his two step sons
        warring over his throne and struggling to fulfill his last wish. Fifteen
        years pass by and a quirky cop finds himself between the ongoing chaos.
        Will the treasure be recovered? Who will reign supreme? The long trailer
        for Avane Srimannarayana set the note for what one could expect in the
        film. This ensures that there's both witticism and wisdom by his side.
        Achyuth makes for his perfect sidekick. And what's a fantasy tale
        without good antagonists and this film has two, there's the menacing
        Jairama and his more cunning half brother Thukarama. The makers have
        ensured the leading lady is more than just a unidimensional figure,
        giving Lakshmi some interesting hues that have the audience rooting for
        her. Add to this a riddle, the pursuit of a missing treasure and a bunch
        of boisterous drama actors, one ends up having quite the scream. Avane
        Srimannarayana scores with its performances, with five primary cast
        members - Rakshit Shetty, Balaji Manohar, Achyuth Kumar, Pramod Shetty
        and Shanvi Srivastava - leading the pack. The cinematography, sets and
        background score elevate the tale. Where the film falters is in the
        narrative, as it tends to become a little too self-indulgent at times.
        Maybe the story could have been a little shorter to ensure a better
        impact of the experience. Avane Srimannarayana is a treat for fans of
        not just Rakshit Shetty, but those who like cinema to be a wholesome
        intelligent exercise. There are a lot of guns blazing and a maverick
        protagonist ready to welcome those who opt to watch the film.
