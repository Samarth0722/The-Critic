      <h3>Our Review</h3>
      <br />
      <p style="font-size: larger;">
        In 1995, we were introduced to the characters Woody and Buzz Lightyear,
        along with a host of others with the film TOY STORY. Since then, we have
        seen two other films in the series release with Woody and Buzz playing
        the mainstay characters who though being just toys have imparted
        valuable lessons. But will this new film from Pixar live up to
        expectations or will it be just another animated flick is what we
        analyse. From there we are taken into the world of Woody, Buzz Lightyear
        and the rest of the gang whose new owner Bonnie is all set to start a
        kindergarten. For those of you who remember the Pixar animated films
        from the days past, let us just say that TOY STORY 4 is sure to bring
        back fond memories. With characters that have already been developed
        over the past three films, a watertight script and a story that takes
        viewers on an emotional roller-coaster ride with twists and turns when
        least expected. In fact, TOY STORY 4 is exactly what you expect a Pixar
        animated film to be, replete with family values and messages conveyed in
        an entertaining fashion that connects with kids and adults alike. In
        terms of animation, Pixar has risen to the call and have done an
        excellent job with making the film. Refined finishes, believable
        movement and most of all, visual emotions that convey feelings
        effortlessly are what makes TOY STORY 4 stand out. On the whole, TOY
        STORY 4 is an entertaining fare as a standalone film and an even better
        one as a finale to a saga. A definite must watch for the young and old
        alike. At the box office, the film will face competition from the other
        big releases, and with low key promotions, the film might find the going
        a bit tough.
