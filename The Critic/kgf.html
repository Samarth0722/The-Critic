      <h3>Our Review</h3>
      <br />
      <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Rocky is an ambitious boy, who wants to die as the richest and most
        powerful man. From the streets of Bombay to the fields of KGF, he
        embarks on the mission. And his tale is being retold by a journalist who
        chronicled his life in the 1980s. Prashanth Neel's KGF, which stars Yash
        in the lead, has become arguably the most spoken about Kannada film
        nationally. The non-linear pattern keeps the viewers engaged, with the
        growth of Rocky being shown in a steady fashion. While there are a fair
        share of scenes and dialogues that bring out the hoots and cheers from
        the masses, the makers have still maintained a clever story telling
        pattern that assures one to also keep pace with the narrative. The film
        traverses from 1951 to 2018, while maintaining a sense of curiosity as
        each character is unveiled. Adding the extra edge to the film are the
        cinematography, art direction and the locales. Everything looks top
        notch and one is often left spellbound at the scenes. Be it the dark
        dreary world in KGF to the more glitzy nightlife scenes in Bangalore,
        all of them are shown beautifully. Yash, as Rocky, lives his character
        to the fullest and his screen presence definitely has the viewers
        cheering alongside him. The ensemble cast play their respective parts,
        with each of them playing minor building blocks in setting up Rocky's
        character. The narrative in the first part builds the character of Rocky
        as the maverick mastermind who will not stop for anything until he
        reaches his mission. While there is a sense of temporary closure in the
        first chapter of the film, one also leaves the hall yearning for more.
        KGF surely seems to have delivered what it set to achieve.
