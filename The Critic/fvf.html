      <h3>Our Review</h3>

      <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Ford Motor Company is struggling with sales in 1963 because they can’t
        seem to connect with the younger market. To boost their image, Lee
        Iacocca (Jon Bernthal) proposes a bold marketing strategy – to win one
        of the most prestigious car races in the world – 24 Hours of Le Mans.
        This poses a unique challenge; the Ferrari racing team has dominated the
        sport for four straight years, and Ford doesn’t have a race car to beat
        them. Caroll Shelby (Matt Damon), a car engineer and designer envisions
        what they need to win the coveted ego boost. Both Caroll Shelby and Ken
        Miles were strong personalities; Matt Damon and Christian Bale
        understand this and use it to fuel the dynamic between their respective
        characters. <br />Christian Bale works his magic yet again playing Miles
        – a volatile underdog that Ford doesn’t want on their team. Miles is at
        the heart of the film, and Bale is mesmerising to watch. Matt Damon is
        far more nuanced as Caroll Shelby, though he gets ample ‘big moments’
        and makes the most of it. The combination is exhilarating; you can’t
        help rooting for the two when they’re on screen, even when there are no
        cars involved. Jon Bernthal is solid, and so is Caitriona Balfe as
        Mollie Miles, but the relationship between Miles and his son Peter,
        played by Noah Jupe, proves to be heartwarming as This pushes the pedal
        on the screenplay, keeping it thrilling and, surprisingly funny enough
        to ensure there’s not a dull moment in two and a half hours. Motorheads
        and racing fans are guaranteed to love ‘Ford v Ferrari’, but even the
        casual moviegoer will get a kick out of it.
