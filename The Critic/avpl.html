      <h3>Our Review</h3>
      <br />
      <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo is set in the soft-tinted, beautifully framed,
        pastel hued cotton-candy-land that Trivikram Srinivas builds. The
        evil-doers here are left to their own devices, in hope that karma will
        get to them. And when that doesn’t work, they’re of course beaten up
        black and blue, but in style.<br />
        The film sets up a lot of characters and ends up showcasing scenarios
        that are completely implausible. But the film’s biggest strength is that
        you buy it all, even if Trivikram, yet again, tells the tale of a man
        who wants to help a family he cares about. He seems more interested in
        his boss Ramachandra’s (Jayram) son Raj Manohar (Sushanth A) than his
        own and there’s a reason for it.Tabu’s character too is poorly fleshed
        out (what a shame), and the emotional scene she has with her husband
        doesn’t completely work. But she’s nothing less than grace personified.
        Sushanth A doesn’t get much to do either. <br />
        In Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo numerous characters are set up, played by
        Nivetha Pethuraj, Rahul Ramakrishna, Navdeep, Sunil, Harsha Vardhan,
        even the antagonist of this tale Samuthirakani and more. Trivikram’s
        fans might miss his trademark punch comedic dialogues, but fitting with
        the theme of the film, the comedy in this one is more dry and sarcastic,
        and it works! Ala Vaikunthapurramuloo has a little bit of everything and
        despite the cliché and predictable storyline; Trivikram manages to make
        it work and deliver what he promises. Watch this one for Allu Arjun,
        especially if you’re a fan, for he shines in this one and of course, the
        fun of it all.
