      <p style="font-size: larger;">
        Arthur Fleck (Joaquin Phoenix) isn’t happy with his life. He struggles
        to make money as a part-time clown while sharing a rundown apartment
        with his ailing mom (Frances Conroy). He also suffers from a condition
        that causes him to break into uncontrollable laughter. None of this
        stops Arthur from dreaming big. He aspires to be a stand-up comedian and
        attempts to write jokes in his diary. Caught in between it all, Arthur
        slowly begins to lose his grip on sanity. It’s immediately apparent that
        this is not your standard comic book fare.Set in the early 80's, this
        fictional city is reminiscent of that era with impeccable production and
        a time-relevant, yet unsettling soundtrack that evokes a constant sense
        of uneasiness. Arthur Fleck’s gradual descent into madness has a distant
        parallel to ‘Taxi Driver’, also featuring Robert De Niro, so there’s a
        sense of joy for the cinephile to see him here. But, none of the cast
        holds a candle to Joaquin Phoenix in the titular role, captured by a
        dedicated and immersive performance. Watching Phoenix disappear into
        character makes one fear the actor’s sanity as he creates his own unique
        version of the villain. At first, his wiry, awkward frame stumbles to
        get from one place to the next, but when he eventually transforms, he
        becomes graceful, resembling an agile dancer. It’s simultaneously
        difficult to watch and yet, impossible to take your eyes off him. If
        Joaquin Phoenix finally wins an Academy Award for this performance, it
        will be hard to argue against it. Disturbing and intense, yet undeniably
        brilliant, this may very well become the definitive origin tale of the
        Joker.
